# A minimal quiz app using **REACT** + **Typescript**.

## Description
A simple app that asks the user questions and counts highscore (saved locally), current score and ratio between correct and incorrect answers.

This an *exercise* by me at Autismuslink!

## Running
To run the app, follow the standard procedure for `vite.js` apps, like say for a local *development* instance, run:
```sh
npm run dev;
```

## Questions
All questions and answers are sourced from `the-trivia-api.com` (free + no API key), please follow their guidelines when using this app.
